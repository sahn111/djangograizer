## General info
I wanted to create a project that uses Django ORM, then I created this app. This is a basic app for some Create, Update and Read operations. I wanted to add Delete too but its really too late maybe tomorrow folks...

There are Cattle and Stable clasess. You can create Cattle and put it one of the Stables, then you can do filtering according to it. Also you can update Cattle's weight and you can see the last update on that Cattle. 

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* Django ( Jinja - ORM )
* HTML
* CSS

	
## Setup

To run this project first create <b>.env</b> file which has example version as <b>.env.example</b>. Then go to the <b>djangoapp</b> directory and just write 
```python3 manage.py runserver``` or ```python manage.py runserver``` to your comment line.

After you can reach the GuessNumber game from <a href = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/cattle'>GuessNumber Game Link</a>

Have fun :)
